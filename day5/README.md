# Day 5

It's intimidating when the problem explanation is harder to parse than the input. At a point, I just had to jump into coding.

I cheated a little and decided to just break the input in two manually while copying into my workspace.

First part took ~25 minutes.

Second part ~20 minutes. I took a couple side tracks here. First I thought it would be funny to see if my machine could just __randomize__ the bad "updates" in a loop until they were correctly sorted. It worked to a point, but I got tired of waiting for the whole program to finish. Next I tried implementing a algorithm to generate all the permutations of the update array. It didn't come easy and I'm glad I gave up on that. Using the actual rules to do the sort was pretty easy.
