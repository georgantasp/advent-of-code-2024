# Day 1

Sent a reminder for everyone that Advent of Code would start on a Sunday Dec1. I completely forgot of course...

Monday! Gotta get two puzzles (4?) done. No time to mess around with environment, just use Golang.

Golang not a great choice. Input parsing is pretty annoying. No built in for absolute value of Int?! Okay...
