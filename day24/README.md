# Day 24

Part1 was relatively easy. Similar to a previous day where the objective is just to implement the computer.

Part2 was difficult because there wasn't really a computational approach. Eventually I found a resource that described [how to build a bitwise adder](https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/combination/comb_7.html). I then created some maps and a loop that looked for gates that didn't seem to match the expected configuration. Pretty manual after all.
