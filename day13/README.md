# Day 13

part1. Started thinking down the path of alegebra one, but I feared having to depend on non-integer math. No problem, brute force can handle this.

part2. Tricked me again. Brute force no longer works as O(a*b) takes too long. Reworking the formulas I also found a solution in O(a) time, but that also too long. Spent more time googling for how to solve systems of equations led me to a linear alegebra solution. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cramer%27s_rule#Applications
