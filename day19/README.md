# Day 19

Part1 was pretty straightforward. I tend to go with a non optimized solution first. Then I put in the "real" input an realize it will never finish. Adding some caching works.

Part2 gave me some trouble. I could blame of lack of concentration time nearing the holiday, but that wouldn't excuse my false starts. Reviewing what I have, seems like there would have to be ways to simplify, but oh well.
