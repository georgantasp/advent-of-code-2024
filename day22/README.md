# Day 22

The most difficult part here was interpreting the directions. The order of operations was pretty confusing to the point where I thought this was going to be impossible. Coming back to it a few days later it wasn't too bad at all.

Part1 and Part2 didn't require any real optimizations just iterate and compute.
