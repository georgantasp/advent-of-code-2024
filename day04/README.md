# Day 4

Okay, starting to get more difficult.

I started part1 thinking it would be smart do matrix translation instead of brute force search. I got stuck here and there, but powered through.

Turned out to be a mistake because part2 was way easier just doing brute force.

This one took me about 90 mins.
