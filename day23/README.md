# Day 23

Jumped here looking for something to accomplish.

Part 1 seemed easy enough, but I misunderstood what the definition of a party was. I assumed any computer connected through any other computer was part of the party. Why would a computer be playing games in multiple parties at the same time?

Part2 I feared would be another time complexity issue. But given the input wasn't super long, it was more of a data structures issues. Figuring out the right logic let me compute all the parties without much optimization and then find the biggest one.
