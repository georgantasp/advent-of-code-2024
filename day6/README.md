# Day 6

This was fun.

Part1 ~40 min. Definitely had some oof by one hiccups. I also realized late in the game that a matrix needs to be referenced with m[y][x], not the other way around. I also had to reread the directions to realize the total needed to be __distinct__ positions.

Part2 ~25 min. How can I brute force a solution when I already overwrote the puzzle?! Have to write a silly copyPuzz function I guess.
