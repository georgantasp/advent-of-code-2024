# Day 9

This one wasn't fun

part1 ~40 min. The directions for part 1 where confusing. Mostly because this isn't how defragging works. Why would I move parts of files, not whole files...

part2 ~60 min in the morning and another 60+ in the evening. Of course part is more like a proper defrag routine. I had to give up after running out of AM time. Picked it up again and pretty much started over. Tracking the fileID after moving the file was painful. Debugging moving items in arrays was painful.
