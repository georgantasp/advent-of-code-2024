# day 12

part1 took a good while to code up, but pretty straightforward.

part2 definitely had more nuance than at first glance. I put together a first pass implementation that worked with the example input, but not with the larger input. I ended up drawing out dozens of "tic tac toe" boards with combindations of "neighbors" and "corner neighbors" to figure out how adding each plot could affect the side count. Even with that, figuring out how to turn those representations into code.
