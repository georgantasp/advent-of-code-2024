# Day 2

This was a fun problem.

I started off trying to make the "safe report" conditions into a single boolean expression. That devolved quickly. It was easier to debug after breaking each condtion out and thats how the code remained

Similarly for part2, I had trouble debugging syntax for breaking up the report and removing 1 element. I ended up turning a 1 liner into 3-4. None-the-less, I was happy I was able to have the safereport method return the index of failure. It did take me a few tries to realize the first two report slots had to be tried explicitly.
