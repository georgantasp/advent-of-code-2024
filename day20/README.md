# Day 20

Part1. seemed pretty easy at first. I pulled some code from day 16 and had it working pretty quickly for the test input. Unfortunately it didn't work for the real input because of stackoverflow. I rewrote to be iterative instead of recursive and done.

Part2 took some time to rework. My day 16 code was basically unrecognizable now. With fingers crossed, I'm checking every possible cheat from every spot on the track without any cache optimization and got the answer.
